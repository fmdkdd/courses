Various courses I created and taught.

- [Domaine](Domaine/) is part of a large introduction to web application
  programming.  There are lectures and exercices focused on introducing HTML and
  CSS, as well as DOM manipulation using JavaScript and some AJAX.

- [FIL](FIL/) and [FING](FING/) are JavaScript courses for second year students.
  These courses focus on the fundamentals of the language itself (objects,
  prototypes, dynamic typing), but the exercises encompass basics (loops,
  arrays, functions) and building concrete applications (e.g. a Pacman clone, or
  a multi-user canvas painting app).

- [pleiad](pleiad) was a course on JavaScript I gave to master students when
  invited at the University of Chile in Santiago.
