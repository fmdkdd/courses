To have a multiuser canvas, you need to start two servers:
1. a standard web server to serve the HTML and JS files to other users
2. a WebSocket server that will broadcast the drawing commands to all
   users

To do that:
1. Open up two consoles, go to this directory (‘multi’).
2. Launch the WebSocket server first, with the command

    node server-websocket.js

   The console should print “WebSocket server started on port 8080”.

3. In the other console, launch the web server with the command

    node node_modules/simple-server/bin/simple-server.js

   Or, in Windows:

    node node_modules\simple-server\bin\simple-server.js

   The console should print “Simple-Server listening to
   http://localhost:3000/ ...”

4. Now open up a web browser and go to the URL
   “http://localhost:3000/index.html”.  You should be able to draw in
   the upper-left area by moving your mouse around.

5. For others to join you, they must know your IP address.  Google is
   your friend.  Once you have that, say “192.167.26.56” you can tell
   them to browse to “http://192.167.26.56:3000/index.html” and you
   will draw on the same canvas.
