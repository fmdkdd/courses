The slides in [2012/](FING/2012/) and [2013/](FING/2013/) are based on reveal.js with a custom REPL plugin.

In [2014/](FING/2014/) I switched to writing markdown and generating DzSlides with pandoc.

In [2014/lab/obj-no-obj](FING/2014/lab/obj-no-obj/) I went a bit overboard and wrote some helpers to automatically grade the assignment, and even check for similarities between them on an AST level.
