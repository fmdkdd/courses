## Function syntax
```
function add(x, y) {
   return x + y;
}
```

## Functions can be anonymous
```
function(x,y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

## Functions are first-class values
- Can return them
- Can pass them as arguments
- Can combine

## Function arity does not matter
- Can be called with any number of args
- If < arity, rest is undefined
- If > arity, surplus is dropped
- f(a) and f(a,b) are the same functions
