The slides in [2012/](FIL/2012/) are based on reveal.js with a custom REPL plugin.

In [2014/](FIL/2014/) I switched to writing the slides in markdown and publishing them to DzSlides using pandoc.

Of note is the handful of prototypes I made in [2014/lab](FIL/2014/lab) looking for suitable exercices.
